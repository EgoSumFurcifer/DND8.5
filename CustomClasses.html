		<h2>Draconist</h2>
		<p>A lizardfolk with red scales stands in front of a hoard and releases his inner fire and burns the group to ashes. A goliath slinks through the shadows, following a party of corrupt noblemen, and with a suprise attack all the noblemen fall in a cloud of darkness that emerged from the goliath's mouth. An elf with gleaming scales and two scimitars whirls through the orc encampment, downing foe after foe before stopping and unleashing a sparkling cloud that puts all the orcs to sleep. A draconist learns the powers of dragons, and adopts those powers into their own body and form. They combine the art of finesse weaponry and draconic gifts to wreak havoc on the battlefield at both short and long ranges.</p>
