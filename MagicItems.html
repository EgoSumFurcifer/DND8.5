<h3>Heward's Handy Hand Grenade</h3>
<p><i>Wonderous Item, Very Rare.</i></p>
<p>Once per turn you can use your action to throw a hand grenade. The grenade splits into two parts, the magical part, and a hand grenade with the pin pulled. It explodes on this initiative count next turn. You can throw the grenade a maximum of 4*strength feet. Any creature within 5 feet takes 2d12 piercing damage, and any within 15 feet takes 1d10+4 thunder damage.</p>
<h3>Gizzard of Lolth</h3>
<p><i>Wonderous Item, Artifact.</i></p>
<p>This orb has 4 charges, and regains 1d4 at each dusk.
You can use a charge to do one of the following:<br>
<strong>Spider-Visionâ„¢</strong>  (1 charge) - You inhabit the body of a nearby spider, assuming one is nearby. You see what it sees, for the next 5 minutes, or until your body takes damage, or you will yourself to return to your body. <br>

<strong>Darkvision</strong> (1 charge)- You gain the effects of the darkvision spell, without expending a spell slot.<br>

<strong>Digest Unpleasant Food</strong> (3 charges) - This is a gizzard, after all. On the next menu-all roll, increase the effect roll by 1.<br>

<strong>Commune with Lolth</strong> (4 charges) -  ???<br>

If you use the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the gizzard desintegrates into a thousand tiny spiders.</p>
<h3>Whip of Imprisonment</h3>

<p>This whip has a +2 to attack and damage rolls, a range of 20 feet, and on a hit the target takes 1d8 extra bludgeoning damage. If you score a critical hit upon a target who is huge or smaller in size you can restrain it untill you choose to release it. If the whip is restraining someone you can make no further attacks with the whip until you release the target.</p>
