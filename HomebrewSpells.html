A target within range must make an intelligence saving thow, taking 10d6 psychic damage on a fail, and half as much on a success. On a fail the target's intelligence score is reduced to 1, for a number of hours equal to 5 times the margin by which it failed the save (minimum 5). While casting the spell you inflict self-harm by means of the same stupidity you so happily unleashed on your foe, reducing your intelligence by 1d10, to a minimum of 1. This effect is permanent until removed by Wish or Greater Restoration.

Those within 10 feet of you take 4d6 psychic damage."</td>
