					<h3 class="grow">The "Most" Sheet</h3>
						<p>Bryce got a little obsessed with finding the maximum speed and AC, here is the result.</p>
					<a href="Familiars.html"><h3 class="grow">Pathfinder Familiars</h3></a>
						<p>Toby missed some parts of Pathfinder, and added some familars from Pathfinder into 5e</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Aging</h3>
						<p>Another part of Pathfinder (maybe) that Toby wanted to add</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Essentials Quick-Reference</h3>
						<p>Quick reference so that we don't have to search through the book when playing remote.</p>
					<a href="ArmorandWeapons.html"><h3 class="grow">Armor</h3></a>
						<p>A reference sheet for all of the armor of 5e, as well as some homebrew.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Weapons</h3>
						<p>A reference sheet for all of the Weapons of 5e, as well as some homebrew.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Character Subclasses</h3>
						<p>A sheet with a short description of each 5e subclass, listing the sourcebook.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Currency Calculator</h3>
						<p>It is what it sounds like. Includes some non-standard currency.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Monster CR</h3>
						<p>Brian made a program that makes decent estimates of monster xp by cr, here is the output.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Player XP per Level</h3>
						<p>Bryce manually made these level thresholds up to level 100.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Menu-all</h3>
						<p>Inspired by something we found online, we decided to create a 5e Menu-all. It describes the sometimes magical effects of eating strange foods.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Menu-all Extras</h3>
						<p>Some creatures, such as Dragons, have one effect for many different creatures. These are on this sheet.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Great Wyrms</h3>
						<p>Great Wyrms should be in 5e. This fixes that.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Rule Exploits</h3>
						<p>5e, like all games, has glitches. Here are the ones we have found so far.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Cool Dice</h3>
						<p>A while ago Bryce and Brian wanted to find some metal dice, this is copied and pasted from thier comparison doc. The images didn't load, sadly.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Rituals</h3>
						<p>There are rituals loosely mentioned, such as the ones to make yuan-ti and half dragons. Here are some specifics.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Further Description</h3>
						<p>When a description gets too long or doesn't fit on a sheet, it goes here.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Math</h3>
						<p>Some of the sheet has automatic calculations, partial math is shown and labled here, it's not really made for looking at.</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Race Creator</h3>
						<p>Helps you think about the features of a custom race. Good for getting ideas, courtesy of Terran</p>
					<h3 class="grow">Cool Stuff on the Internet</h3>
