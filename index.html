			<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>This website is a collection of Dungeons and Dragons content edited, compiled, created, and sometimes stolen
		by four madmen. Their names and roles in bringing this horrible amalgamation into existence are below, although many of these things apply to the old google sheet.</p>

				<h3>Tobias</h3>
				<p>Porting information from google sheets to this website, coding the html and css for the website, pathfinderizing 5e 
			(New armor and weapons, familiars, etc.).</p>
				<h3>Terran</h3>
				<p>Race Creator, Helping to style the website.</p>
			<h2>Support Us!</h2>
				<p> We don't have a patreon or ay way to recieve money, but there are other ways you can help!</p>
				<h3>Bronze Tier</h3>
				<p> To access the bronze tier, you must simply burn a sheet of paper bearing our names on it. There must be a pentagram inscribed upon the sheet. For best results, only burn once on every new moon, prefereably outdoors.</p>
				<h3>Silver Tier</h3>
				<p> Supporting us on this tier will be a bit more involved. It is necessary to get a plank of wood at least half an inch thick and at least two feet long and wide. You will need to sacrifice some form of fowl upon the board (Duck, Chicken, Pheasant, etc.) preferably by decapitation. Then, using the blood of the fowl, draw a pentagram at least eight inches in radius and inscribe our names inside it. Burn the piece of wood, without the fowl, after it has been allowed to dry for at least a week and a day, but less than two weeks. The fowl should be eaten in a ritualistic feast after the inscription.</p>
				<h3>Gold Tier</h3>
				<p> The final tier is not for the faint of heart. The materials needed will be several gallons of gasoline, kerosene, or some other sufficiently flammable liquid, a live goat under the age  of 1 year (preferably six months six weeks and six days old) a large knife, a portable cement mixer, several matches, and a wide, flat area, preferably a park, ballcourt, or other public space. First, gather the goat and up to three bystanders (any more would risk a demon summoning of type 3 or greater, which might be a bit too much fun to handle). Then, slit their throughts starting with the most easily corruptable bystander, dump their blood into the portable cement mixer, proceeding to progressively younger victims until you reach the goat. After the goat's blood has been added, turn on the portable cement mixer and add the pyroforic mixture slowly, at a ratio of around a gallon per victim drained, adjusting for size. At this point, law enforcement has most likely beern dispatched to your location, so you have to hurry. If they are already near, it may be necessary to cast <i>Zorithan's Greater Isolation Sphere</i>. Using the wheels of the mixer to your advantage, pour a generous helping of blood in a 30 foot diameter circle. Once around five gallons are left, use one gallon to form each line of the pentagram. As usual, write our name in the middle of the circle with blood, using cursive to attach the letters so that they combust without having to ignite the fluid slurry multiple times. Connect these letters to the interior pentagon of the pentagram, and, standing in the middle of the shape, ignite the liquid, knowing that as the inferno engulfs your mortal form, your soul will feed a higher purpose.<br>Us.</p>
