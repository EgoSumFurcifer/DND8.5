					<a href="HomebrewSpells.html"><h4>Homebrew Spells</h4></a>
						<p>A list of spells we cooked up, they may or may not be balanced.</p>
					<h4>Homebrew Clases</h4>
						<p>Our homebrew classes</p>
					<h4>Homebrew Subclasses</h4>
						<p>Our homebrew subclasses</p>
					<h4>Homebrew Monsters</h4>
						<p>Our homebrew monsters</p>
					<h4>Magic Items</h4>
						<p>Various magic items we cooked up for our sessions or just thought were cool.</p>
					<h4>The "Most" Sheet</h4>
						<p>Bryce got a little obsessed with finding the maximum speed and AC, here is the result.</p>
					<h4>Pathfinder Familiars</h4>
						<p>Toby missed some parts of Pathfinder, and added some familars from Pathfinder into 5e</p>
					<h4>Aging</h4>
						<p>Another part of Pathfinder (maybe) that Toby wanted to add</p>
					<h4>Essentials Quick-Reference</h4>
						<p>Quick reference so that we don't have to search through the book when playing remote.</p>
					<h4>Armor and Weapons</h4>
						<p>A reference sheet for all of the armor and weapons of 5e, as well as some homebrew.</p>
					<h4>Character Subclasses</h4>
						<p>A sheet with a short description of each 5e subclass, listing the sourcebook.</p>
					<h4>Currency Calculator</h4>
						<p>It is what it sounds like. Includes some non-standard currency.</p>
					<h4>Monster CR</h4>
						<p>Brian made a program that makes decent estimates of monster xp by cr, here is the output.</p>
					<h4>Player XP per Level</h4>
						<p>Bryce manually made these level thresholds up to level 100.</p>
					<h4>Menu-all</h4>
						<p>Inspired by something we found online, we decided to create a 5e Menu-all. It describes the sometimes magical effects of eating strange foods.</p>
					<h4>Menu-all Extras</h4>
						<p>Some creatures, such as Dragons, have one effect for many different creatures. These are on this sheet.</p>
					<h4>Great Wyrms</h4>
						<p>Great Wyrms should be in 5e. This fixes that.</p>
					<h4>Rule Exploits</h4>
						<p>5e, like all games, has glitches. Here are the ones we have found so far.</p>
					<h4>Cool Dice</h4>
						<p>A while ago Bryce and Brian wanted to find some metal dice, this is copied and pasted from thier comparison doc. The images didn't load, sadly.</p>
					<h4>Rituals</h4>
						<p>There are rituals loosely mentioned, such as the ones to make yuan-ti and half dragons. Here are some specifics.</p>
					<h4>Further Description</h4>
						<p>When a description gets too long or doesn't fit on a sheet, it goes here.</p>
					<h4>Math</h4>
						<p>Some of the sheet has automatic calculations, partial math is shown and labled here, it's not really made for looking at.</p>
					<h4>Race Creator</h4>
						<p>Helps you think about the features of a custom race. Good for getting ideas, courtesy of Terran</p>
					<h4>Cool Stuff on the Internet</h4>
						<p>Other people have made cool stuff, heres some things we've found on our adventures.</p>
