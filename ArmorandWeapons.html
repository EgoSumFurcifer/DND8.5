<h3>Further Description</h3>
	<h4>Buckler</h4>
		<p>This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an offhand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you lose the buckler’s Armor Class bonus until your next turn. You can cast a spell with somatic components using your shield arm, but you lose the buckler’s Armor Class bonus until your next turn. You can’t make a shield bash with a buckler.</p>
	<h4>Tower Shield</h4>
		<p>In most situations, a tower shield provides the indicated shield bonus to your Armor Class. As a standard action, however, you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover until the beginning of your next turn. When using a tower shield in this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for attacks that do not pass through this edge (see Combat). The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.</p>
	<h4>Spiked Shields</h4>
		<p>Shield bash attacks deal 1d6 piercing. Can't be used on tower or buckler shields.</p>
	<h4>Armor Spikes</h4>
		<p>1d6 damage per turn to any creature grappling you or that moves through your space.</p>
	<h4>Locked Gauntlets</h4>
		<p>You can lock a weapon to your hand using the system of chains on this gauntlet. Removing or attaching a weapon takes a full round action, but you can't be unwillingly disarmed.</p>
